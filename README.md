# Churn_modelling_ANN_Classification
Churn Prediction Model :  It’s a predictive model that estimates — at the level of individual customers — the propensity (or susceptibility) they have to leave. For each customer at any given time, it tells us how high the risk is of losing them in the future.  Technically, it’s a binary classifier that divides clients into two groups (classes) — those who leave and those who don’t. In addition to assigning them to one of the two groups, it will typically give us the probability with which the client belongs to that group.  It is important to note that this is the probability of belonging to the group of clients who leave. Thus, it is the propensity to leave and not the probability of leaving. However, it is possible to estimate the probability through a churn model.  Business Problem :  This data set contains details of a bank's customers and the target variable is a binary variable(Exited) reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer. The goal here is to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e. exited = 1) using the provided features.
